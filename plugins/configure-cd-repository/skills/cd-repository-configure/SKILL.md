You are tasked with creating a scoped CD Repository configuration from CI Repository changes.

## Input Parameters

- **Context Folder Path** - Folder that contains `cd-repository-context.json` produced by `cd-repository-discovery`.
- **Change Selectors** - Provide **either** PR number(s) **or** a git commit range (not both):
  - **PR mode:** One or more PR numbers (e.g., `PR 312` or `PR 310, PR 311, PR 312`)
  - **Commit mode:** One git commit range (e.g., `abc123..def456` or `abc123^..def456`)

Choose PR mode when deploying specific, discrete changes; choose commit mode when deploying all changes between two commits.

## Prerequisite

Read `cd-repository-context.json` from the provided folder and validate:

- `appPath`
- `repositoryRoot`
- `ciRepositoryPath`
- `cdRepositoryConfigPath`
- `tooling.preferredChangeSource`
- `discovery.repositoryConfigVersion` must be `"2"`

If the context file is missing or invalid, stop and ask the user to run `cd-repository-discovery` (or fix the file).

**If `discovery.repositoryConfigVersion` is `"1"` or missing:** Stop and inform the user:
> "The repository.config file uses the legacy v1 syntax. The `cd-repository-configure` skill requires v2 syntax. Please run the `cd-repository-upgrade` skill to migrate your configuration to v2, then run `cd-repository-discovery` again to generate an updated context file. See [Migrate CI/CD repository.config to v2](https://docs.kentico.com/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/configure-ci-cd-repositories/config-v2-migration) for details."

## Workflow

1. Load discovery context and confirm paths still exist.
2. Resolve change source strategy:
   - Prefer `gh` when context says `gh` and `gh` is available.
   - Otherwise use local git commands.
3. **Collect and classify CI changes for each selector:**
   - **PR mode:** Collect file list and changes for each PR separately.
   - **Commit range mode:** 
     - List all commits in the range using `git log <range> --pretty=format:"%H %s"`.
     - For each commit in the range (oldest to newest):
       - Run `git show <commit-hash> --name-status -- <ciRepositoryPath>` to get CI files changed in that commit.
       - Extract commit subject/message to classify the commit intent.
       - Classify the commit as **Business/feature** or **Xperience update-only** (see Change Classification Guidance below).
       - Track CI changes per commit separately.
4. Keep only files under `ciRepositoryPath` that belong to non-excluded commits.
5. Aggregate CI changes across all non-excluded commits into:
   - **Business/feature changes** (include in deployment filtering)
   - **Xperience update-only changes** (exclude by default)
6. Exclude entire commits marked as `Xperience update-only` unless user explicitly requests inclusion.
7. Map remaining CI paths to object types and code names.
8. Update `cdRepositoryConfigPath`:
   - Build minimal `IncludedObjectTypes` allowlist (main object types only).
   - Add/merge `ObjectFilters` with one `IncludedCodeNames` entry per object type using semicolon-separated code names.
   - **Determine RestoreMode:**
     - Analyze git history: if **all** CI `.xml` files under `ciRepositoryPath` are **new** (created), use `Create` mode for better performance.
     - If **any** CI `.xml` files are **modified** (updated), use `CreateUpdate` mode to preserve existing objects.
     - **Note:** Create mode has significant performance benefits, especially for content item deployments. Use CreateUpdate only when necessary for file updates.
9. Validate XML and remove duplicate/contradicting filters.
10. Diff and explain exact changes.
11. If available in the repository, run `Export-DeploymentPackage.ps1` to generate the deployment package. **Manually verify** that the generated package contains the expected scoped objects. (The script copies your CD Repository into the package; it does not validate CD filters.)

## Change Classification Guidance

Treat changes as **Xperience update-only** when they originate from platform/package update work (for example hotfix/version bump PRs or commits) and do not represent intentional business configuration/content modeling changes.

Common signals:

- PR/commit title or description indicates Xperience update, hotfix, NuGet/package bump, or version migration.
- Bulk CI churn tied to upgrade commits with no explicit feature intent.

When uncertain, default to safety:

- Exclude ambiguous update-related groups.
- Report exclusions clearly so user can opt in.

## Mapping Hints

Common CI paths to object types:

- `@global/cms.contenttype` -> `cms.contenttype`
- `@global/cms.user` -> `cms.systemtable` *(unintuitive: folder is `cms.user` but config uses `cms.systemtable`)*
- `@global/cms.member` -> `cms.systemtable`
- `@global/cms.contact` -> `cms.systemtable`
- `@global/cms.class` -> `cms.class` *(see note below about ambiguity)*
- `@global/emaillibrary.emailtemplate` -> `emaillibrary.emailtemplate`
- `@global/cms.settingskey` -> `cms.settingskey` *(excluded from CI/CD by default due to potentially sensitive data; flag this to the user if it appears in a diff)*

**Channel-scoped content (pages, emails, headless items):** These are stored under `<ChannelName>/` rather than `@global/`. For example, `DancingGoat/cms.contentitem/` contains pages for the DancingGoat website channel. When these paths appear in CI changes, use `IncludedContentItemsOfType` / `ContentItemFilters` (v2) rather than `ObjectFilters`. See [CI/CD object type reference](https://docs.kentico.com/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/reference-ci-cd-object-types#content-management) for details.

**Resolving content item code names from channel-scoped diffs:** When a diff shows a change under `<ChannelName>/contentitemdata.<type>/<folder>/`, the folder name encodes the item as `<itemcodename>-<guid_prefix>` but is not directly usable as a `ContentItemFilters` code name. Always resolve the canonical code name by reading the corresponding `<ChannelName>/cms.contentitem/<itemcodename-guid>.xml` file and extracting the `<ContentItemName>` element. This is the value to use in `<IncludedContentItemNames>`.

**Content type not changed but new items of that type were added:** When a CI diff adds new content item files under `@global/contentitemdata.<type>/` or `@global/cms.contentitem/` for a type whose `@global/cms.contenttype/<type>.xml` was **not** changed in any of the included commits, that content type must still be included in **both** `IncludedContentItemsOfType` and `ObjectFilters/IncludedCodeNames ObjectType="cms.contenttype"`. The type definition is unchanged but the type must be present in both places for `kxp-cd-store` to include the new items in the deployment package.

**Forms require two object types:** Both `@global/cms.form/` and `@global/cms.formclass/` must be included together. The `cms.formclass` files use a `bizform.` code name prefix (e.g., `bizform.userfeedback.xml`). Include both in `IncludedObjectTypes`:

  ```xml
  <IncludedObjectTypes>
    <ObjectType>cms.form</ObjectType>
    <ObjectType>cms.formclass</ObjectType>
  </IncludedObjectTypes>
  ```

**`@global/cms.class` ambiguity:** This folder covers both module class definitions and reusable field schema definitions. Inspect the file code names to determine which is present before scoping `ObjectFilters`.

**`@global/cms.contentitemcommondata/` vs `@global/cms.class/cms.contentitemcommondata.xml` — do not confuse these two paths:**

- `@global/cms.contentitemcommondata/<itemcodename>/` — these are **child data files** for individual content items (language variants, draft state, etc.). They are covered automatically when the parent content type is included via `IncludedContentItemsOfType`. Do **not** add `cms.contentitemcommondata` to `ObjectFilters`; the v2 format disallows it and will throw an exception.
- `@global/cms.class/cms.contentitemcommondata.xml` — this single file is the **reusable field schema definition** and must be explicitly included via `cms.class` in `ObjectFilters` when changed.

**Reusable field schemas** -> Object type `cms.class`. Reusable field schema definitions are tracked via the `CMS.ContentItemCommonData` code name (file path `App_Data\CIRepository\@global\cms.class\cms.contentitemcommondata.xml`). To include them, add both an `IncludedObjectTypes` entry and an `ObjectFilters` entry:

  ```xml
  <IncludedObjectTypes>
    <ObjectType>cms.class</ObjectType>
  </IncludedObjectTypes>
  <ObjectFilters>
    <!-- Contains reusable field schema definitions -->
    <IncludedCodeNames ObjectType="cms.class">
      CMS.ContentItemCommonData
    </IncludedCodeNames>
  </ObjectFilters>
  ```

  See [CI/CD object type reference](https://docs.kentico.com/documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/reference-ci-cd-object-types#content-management) for details.

## Decision Rules

- If `IncludedObjectTypes` is populated, it is an allowlist: include every required main object type.
- Child and binding objects follow parent inclusion rules.
- Prefer explicit object types over broad `IncludeAll` patterns.
- Add content-item-specific filters only when content item deployment is intentionally requested.
- Keep code name filters minimal and precise.
- **When `IncludedObjectTypes` contains `cms.contenttype` and `ObjectFilters` has an `IncludedCodeNames ObjectType="cms.contenttype"` entry, every content type listed in `IncludedContentItemsOfType` must also appear in that `ObjectFilters` code name list** — regardless of whether the type definition itself was changed in the included commits. If a type is missing from `ObjectFilters`, `kxp-cd-store` will silently suppress all content items of that type from the deployment package.

## Formatting Guidelines

Write code names one per line for readability. Within a single `<IncludedCodeNames>` element, list each code name on its own indented line with a semicolon separator (no trailing semicolon on the last entry):

```xml
<ObjectFilters>
  <IncludedCodeNames ObjectType="cms.contenttype">
    DancingGoat.Cafe;
    DancingGoat.FAQItem;
    DancingGoat.BuilderEmail
  </IncludedCodeNames>
  <IncludedCodeNames ObjectType="cms.class">
    CMS.ContentItemCommonData
  </IncludedCodeNames>
</ObjectFilters>
```

For `ContentItemFilters`, use a separate `<IncludedContentItemNames>` element per item (not semicolons), one per line:

```xml
<ContentItemFilters>
  <IncludedContentItemNames>BostonCoffeePlace-034jwdxo</IncludedContentItemNames>
  <IncludedContentItemNames>CafePhoto-nu2tjd9a</IncludedContentItemNames>
</ContentItemFilters>
```

## Quality Checks

- XML is well-formed.
- No repeated `IncludedCodeNames` entries for the same object type.
- Code names match actual CI object code names from XML files.
- Code names listed one per line within elements (see Formatting Guidelines above).
- Update-only groups are excluded (unless user opted in).
- Final config diff is concise and justified.
- **Every `<ContentType>` listed in `IncludedContentItemsOfType` also appears in `ObjectFilters/IncludedCodeNames ObjectType="cms.contenttype"`** (when that filter element is present). Any content type absent from `ObjectFilters` will have its content items silently excluded from the deployment package by `kxp-cd-store`.

## Output Format

Finish with a concise deployment summary:

- **Source selectors analyzed:**
  - For commit ranges: list all commits in the range with their subjects and classification (Business/Feature vs. Xperience update-only)
  - For PRs: list all PR numbers analyzed
- **Commits included in deployment scope** (with hashes and subjects)
- **Commits excluded as Xperience update-only** (with hashes, subjects, and reason for exclusion)
- Selected object types for deployment
- Selected code names by object type
- Determined RestoreMode and reasoning (Create vs. CreateUpdate based on git history)
- Exact impact on `repository.config`
- Validation result for deployment package export (if executed)
