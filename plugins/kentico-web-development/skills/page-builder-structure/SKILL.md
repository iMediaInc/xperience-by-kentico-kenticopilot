# Page Builder structure: sections and page templates

This skill points you to what you need to build the structural layers of Page Builder in an Xperience by Kentico project: **sections** (arrange widget zones inside an editable area) and **page templates** (define a page's full layout). Study the project's existing sections and templates first, verify APIs against the docs below, then implement and test.

## Pieces of Page Builder structure

- **Sections** – layout of widget zones within an editable area; _basic_ (partial view) or _view-component-based_. Registered with `RegisterSection`, optional `ISectionProperties`.
- **Widget zones** – the slots inside a section that hold widgets; identifiers matter when editors switch section type.
- **Default section** – the section applied to new/unstyled areas.
- **Page templates** – full-page MVC layouts editors assign to a page. Registered with `RegisterPageTemplate`, scoped by content type.
- **Editable areas** – the Page Builder regions of a template; identifiers matter when editors switch template.

## How to use

- Read `references/docs.md` — the documentation map. Fetch the relevant pages via the Kentico Docs MCP.
