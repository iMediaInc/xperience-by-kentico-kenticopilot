# Kentico digital experience

Extend the digital marketing features of Xperience by Kentico with custom components, written by your AI coding assistant.

Marketers configure these features using the component types available to them. When they need behavior Xperience doesn't provide out of the box, such as posting to a chat channel, calling an internal service, or starting a process the moment an order is paid, a developer adds a custom component — a step inside a process, or the trigger that starts it. This plugin hands that work to your coding assistant. You explain what the component does and which settings marketers control, and the agent writes the implementation together with the registration that makes it available in the admin UI.

## Choose a skill

| Skill | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `automation-action` | Implement and register a custom automation action, with optional marketer-configurable properties |
| `automation-trigger` | Implement and register a custom automation trigger, and fire it from your application code |

The two skills meet in one process: a trigger decides when the process starts and what data it carries, and actions are the steps that run afterwards, reading that data as they go. Build the trigger first when the starting event is the custom part.

For the other kinds of automation customization, see the [customization overview](https://docs.kentico.com/x/automation_custom_xp).

> [!TIP]
> New to agent skills? Agents activate skills as necessary based on the assigned task. Alternatively, you can use slash commands and other methods depending on your assistant. For what that means in practice, read [Invoke a skill](../../docs/Usage-Guide.md#invoke-a-skill).

## Requirements

- An Xperience by Kentico project with [Automation](https://docs.kentico.com/x/automation_xp) in use
- An AI coding assistant with this plugin installed
- The [Documentation MCP server](https://docs.kentico.com/x/mcp_server_xp), configured as described in [MCP setup](./MCP-setup.md)
- A description of what the component does, and of any settings marketers need to change

Additionally, `automation-trigger` requires:

- The code path that should start the process — an event handler, a controller or webhook endpoint, or a scheduled task
- The contact the process applies to, and any data the trigger passes into it

## Install

Follow the marketplace instructions in the [usage guide](../../docs/Usage-Guide.md#install-the-selected-plugin), using the plugin name `kentico-digital-experience`.

## Build your first action

This sequence produces one working action, configurable by marketers. See the other sections for more use cases and prompt examples.

1. Open the solution containing your Xperience web project in your AI coding assistant.

2. Describe the step and its settings in the prompt. The more specific you are, the fewer questions the agent needs to ask. For examples, see [Write effective prompts](#write-effective-prompts).

   ```text
   /automation-action

   Create an action that sends a Slack message to a configured webhook
   when a contact reaches this step. Marketers need to edit the webhook
   URL and the message template.
   ```

3. Answer the design questions. The agent reads the current Xperience documentation and studies how your project is organized, then confirms the design before writing anything. Expect it to ask about whatever you left open, such as how the step behaves when the external call fails.

4. Review the generated code. The agent reports which files it created. Read [Review the output](#review-the-output).

5. Build the project and restart the application, then open the **Automation** application and add your step to a process. Confirm the step appears under its display name and that its properties render in the configuration dialog.

At this point the step is available to every marketer working in the Automation Builder, and it runs for each contact that reaches it.

## Build your first trigger

A trigger is two halves: the class marketers select in the Automation Builder, and the call in your code that fires it. The agent writes both.

1. Describe the event, the data it carries, and where in the code it happens.

   ```text
   /automation-trigger

   Create a trigger that starts a process when a customer completes a
   purchase, carrying the order number, total, and currency. Marketers
   need to set a minimum order total. Fire it from the checkout
   controller after the payment is confirmed.
   ```

2. Answer the design questions. Expect the agent to confirm which contact the trigger applies to and how the process should behave when the same contact purchases twice.

3. Review the generated code, including the dispatch call the agent added to your own class. Read [Review the output](#review-the-output).

4. Build the project and restart the application, then open the **Automation** application and create a process that starts from your trigger.

5. Exercise the code path — place an order, raise the event, or run the scheduled task — and confirm the process starts for the expected contact.

## Common tasks

### Add an automation action with no settings

The agent skips the properties class entirely.

```text
/automation-action

Add an action that writes an information-level log entry with the
contact's email address. No marketer-facing settings.
```

### Drive the configuration from a requirements file

Point the agent at examples, specification documents, or an existing implementation. The agent reads the source instead of your summary of it, which produces a closer match.

```text
/automation-action

Implement the action described in ./requirements/crm-sync.md and follow
the conventions of the components already in this project.
```

### Add a property to an existing action

Describe the action and the setting. The agent finds the existing classes and extends them rather than starting over.

```text
Add a retry-count setting to the CrmSyncAction, editable by marketers,
with a default of 3 and a maximum of 10.
```

### Pass data from a trigger into the process

Data set when the trigger fires stays available to every step of the process.

```text
/automation-trigger

Extend the PurchaseTrigger to carry the order number and the sales
channel, and read both in the CrmSyncAction step.
```

### Fire an existing trigger on a schedule

Time-based automation is a scheduled task that fires the trigger for each matching contact.

```text
/automation-trigger

Add a scheduled task that fires the SubscriptionExpiringTrigger once a
day for every contact whose subscription ends within seven days.
```

## Write effective prompts

Both of these prompts produce a working output. However, providing the agent with more context significantly reduces guesswork and increases output quality and standards adherence. Compare:

| Prompt | What happens |
|---|---|
| `Create an action that sends an email` | The agent works out the recipient, the source of the content, and which parts marketers control. Expect several rounds of questions. |
| `Create an action that sends the contact a transactional email chosen by the marketer from a dropdown of published email templates` | The agent proposes a design right away and asks only about what you left open. |
| `Create a trigger for purchases` | The agent works out the event, the data the process needs, and which class fires it. Expect several rounds of questions. |
| `Create a trigger fired from OrderController.Confirm that carries the order number and total, and only starts the process above a marketer-set minimum` | The agent knows the firing location, the payload, and the one marketer-facing setting. |

## Review the output

Treat generated code the way you'd treat a pull request from someone new to the project. The following things are worth reviewing:

**Form annotation namespace** -- The [form component](https://docs.kentico.com/x/8ASiCQ) attributes that build the configuration dialog need to come from the `Kentico.Xperience.Admin.*.FormAnnotations` namespaces. An obsolete Form Builder namespace, `Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc`, contains attributes with the same names. Check the `using` directives on the properties class.

**Execution time limit** -- Actions are cancelled after two minutes, so a step calling a slow external service can be cut off mid-run. If the generated code talks to anything outside the application, read [Best practices](https://docs.kentico.com/x/automation_custom_steps_xp) for the timeout behavior and what to do instead. The same limit applies to a trigger's evaluation, and a trigger that runs out of time does not start its process.

**Trigger identifiers** -- The identifier on the registration attribute, and the one on the trigger data class, are permanent. Changing either after marketers have built processes on the trigger breaks those processes. Renaming or removing a data property has the same effect, and the affected steps then receive no data. Check that the generated identifiers are ones you can live with, and that they carry a prefix unique to your project.

**Trigger data** -- Trigger data is serialized and stored with the process. Keep it to identifiers the process can resolve later, and keep personal data such as names and e-mail addresses out of it.

**Firing location** -- Confirm the dispatch call sits where the business event actually completes, and that it isn't inside a custom automation step. Firing is fire-and-forget from a bounded queue, so the call returns before the process starts and tells you nothing about whether it did.

Other things to keep an eye on during review:

- Use `ILogger<T>` for [logging](https://docs.kentico.com/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/logging).
- Check the failure path, and what happens when the same contact enters the step twice.
- Consider [data protection](https://docs.kentico.com/x/zIB1CQ) issues for anything the step sends outside the application.
- Open the configuration dialog in the **Automation** application and verify the output.

## Customize

Record project-specific conventions in your project's agent instruction files. The agent otherwise infers coding conventions from surrounding code each time. Instructions kept in the project apply to every task and survive plugin updates.
