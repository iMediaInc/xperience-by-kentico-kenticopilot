You implement a custom **automation process action** in an Xperience by Kentico project — a step type that appears in the Automation Builder and runs `Execute` for every contact (or other processed object) that reaches it.

## What you must produce

1. A class extending **`CMS.Automation.AutomationAction`** (no properties) or **`CMS.Automation.AutomationAction<TProperties>`** (with properties).
2. An assembly-level **`[assembly: RegisterAutomationAction<TAction>(identifier, displayName, IconName = ..., Description = ...)]`**.
3. If properties: a **`TProperties`** class implementing `CMS.Automation.IAutomationActionProperties` with form-component-annotated public read/write properties, in **its own file** (`<ActionClass>Properties.cs`) — not co-located in the action's file.
4. If the action shares cross-step state: an **`IAutomationProcessData`** implementation with a unique `static abstract string Identifier`.
5. If the project uses `.resx` localization in `Register*` attributes (look for `"{$...$}"` strings): the new display name, description, and labels in the existing `.resx`, referenced via the `{$...$}` syntax.

## Steps

### 1. Read context

- Read **`references/guardrails.md`** — code quality guardrails beyond the API spec.
- Study **`references/example-actions.md`** — canonical action samples covering distinct patterns (service injection, typed `HttpClient`, cross-step process data, no-properties actions). Mirror their structure and conventions, including one class per file.
- Fetch the action API contract from the live documentation via the **Kentico Docs MCP** — the **Custom automation steps** page listed in **`references/docs.md`** is authoritative for the base classes, the `RegisterAutomationAction<TAction>` attribute and its parameters (`identifier`, `displayName`, optional `IconName`, `Description`), identifier constraints, the `AutomationProcessContext` (processed contact via `GetProcessedObject`, process name, trigger data, cross-step `GetProcessData<T>` / `SetProcessData<T>`), and `IAutomationProcessData`. Do not rely on memorized API shapes — confirm against the page.
- Fetch the supplementary docs listed in **`references/docs.md`** via the Kentico Docs MCP as needed (form-component reference, visibility conditions, validation rules — see `references/docs.md` for the catalog of pages worth fetching on demand).

### 2. Discover the project and the surrounding APIs

- Search for `AutomationAction<` and `RegisterAutomationAction<`. If existing actions are found, mirror their folder, namespace, and registration style.
- If none exist, follow the project's conventions for similar extensibility (widgets, page templates). Default to an `Automation/` folder at the project root.
- Note DI registration patterns and whether the project uses `.resx` localization in component metadata.
- **Verify the API surface of any Xperience service you plan to inject** (e.g. `IConsentAgreementService`, `IInfoProvider<TInfo>`, `INotificationEmailMessageProvider`) before calling its methods — check the actual method signatures, return types, and whether they are sync or async. Do not assume.
- **If the action integrates with an external service** (Twilio, Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, a webhook, an SDK, etc.) — briefly research that service's documentation and request shape (via Kentico Docs MCP for Kentico-side concerns, and via WebSearch/WebFetch for the third-party API). Enough to make the SDK call or HTTP payload look realistic, including: the canonical SDK entry point or HTTP endpoint, required authentication shape, the request body, and how the provider signals errors / duplicates. Capture credentials in a typed `*Options` class bound to `appsettings.json` — never on `TProperties`.

### 3. Confirm the design

Walk through **`assets/ACTION_TEMPLATE.md`** with the user in chat — identifier, display name, icon, tooltip, base class, properties (name, type, form component, default, validation rules, visibility conditions), runtime behavior (inputs, side effects, failure handling), injected dependencies, and any `IAutomationProcessData` types the action reads or writes. **Do not save the template to disk** — it is an in-chat scaffold, not an artifact.

Ask only what you cannot reasonably infer. Propose defaults the user can override.

### 4. Implement

Write the files following these rules (full detail in `guardrails.md`):

- One class per file: the action, its `TProperties`, each `IAutomationProcessData`, and any typed `*Options` each go in their own file named after the class.
- Constructor injection for dependencies; verify every injected service is registered with the DI container.
- Use `ILogger<T>` for logging — not `IEventLogService`.
- Never `.Result`/`.Wait()`; no static mutable state; no per-execution state in instance fields.
- Retrieve the processed contact with `ContactInfo contact = await context.GetProcessedObject(cancellationToken);` (extension method in `CMS.ContactManagement`) — see the canonical pattern in `guardrails.md`. Do not read `context.ProcessedObject` directly; it is not part of the public API.
- External calls keyed by a stable identifier on the cast contact (typically `ContactInfo.ContactID`; prefer `ContactInfo.ContactGUID` when the external system needs a globally stable key) for idempotency.
- No secrets in `TProperties` — read them from `IConfiguration` / `IOptions<T>`.
- Outbound HTTP uses typed `HttpClient` registered with `services.AddHttpClient<TAction>()`.
- Prefer declarative validation attributes (`RequiredValidationRule`, `MaxLengthValidationRule`, `MinimumIntegerValueValidationRule`, `MaximumIntegerValueValidationRule`, `MinimumDecimalValueValidationRule`, ...) on `TProperties` instead of hand-rolled checks in `Execute`. Reserve `Execute` validation for cross-property or runtime conditions only.
- Form-component attributes and validation rules come from `Kentico.Xperience.Admin.Base.FormAnnotations` (plus `Kentico.Xperience.Admin.Content.FormAnnotations` and `Kentico.Xperience.Admin.DigitalMarketing.FormAnnotations` for content- and marketing-specific selectors). Do **not** import `Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc` — that namespace contains obsolete classes with matching names (`ValidationRule`, `RegisterFormValidationRule`, ...) for the live-site Form Builder, which is the wrong API surface here.

### 5. Verify

- Run `dotnet build` on the web project.
- Confirm the identifier is unique in the solution (grep the identifier string).
- If you added `.resx` strings, confirm the `.resx` and its registration class compile.

Report what you produced and the manual steps (if any) the user still owes — typically registering a new dependency in DI or adding a configuration value to `appsettings.json`.
