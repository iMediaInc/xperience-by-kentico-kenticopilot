# Contributing setup

This repository contains AI agent skills, instructions, and related materials for Xperience by Kentico development assistance. This guide explains how to contribute changes to these materials.

## What belongs here

These resources are for **Kentico Xperience developers** and are used through AI assistants and tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude Code) to help complete tasks more efficiently. Resources intended for non-developers (e.g., marketing, sales, or support) should not be added here.

Resources must not duplicate information already available in the Kentico documentation. Instead, link the relevant documentation pages and provide additional context.

**Before adding anything**, be clear about the feature's purpose — what it accomplishes and how it will be used — then decide whether a new resource is truly needed, or whether the same result can be achieved with an existing resource, a link to our documentation, or a well-written prompt.

## Documentation structure

Keep each document focused on one reader need:

| Document | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Root `README.md` | Explain the marketplace, help users choose a plugin, and provide a short installation path |
| Plugin `README.md` | Explain when to use the plugin, how its skills fit together, requirements, examples, and how to review what it produces |
| `SKILL.md` | Instruct the agent how to execute one task; do not use it as the primary user guide |
| Skill `references/` | Give the agent focused material it loads only when needed |

Avoid repeating marketplace setup in every plugin README. Link to the usage guide and provide the plugin name instead. Keep exact task parameters and execution guardrails in `SKILL.md`; plugin READMEs should summarize them and show representative prompts rather than restating the full skill.

Cross-skill workflows belong under the repository `docs/` directory when they span a full user journey.

## Resource types

There are three basic types of resource you can add. Use this table to help you get started:

| Resource | Lives in                            | Name format                        | `kentico-` prefix     | Touches manifests? |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Plugin   | `plugins/<name>/`                   | lowercase, hyphenated              | **Yes**               | Register in both   |
| Skill    | `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/`   | lowercase, hyphenated, descriptive | No (scoped by plugin) | No                 |
| Subagent | `plugins/<plugin>/agents/<name>.md` | lowercase, hyphenated, descriptive | No (scoped by plugin) | No                 |

**Shared conventions** (apply to every resource): keep each one lean and tightly scoped — a plugin to one domain, a skill or subagent to a single task; write descriptions that trigger the resource reliably but aren't so long they become overwhelming; and avoid features or fields specific to a single AI tool, since these resources are used by different AI assistants. All files related to a resource live inside that resource's folder.

### Plugin

A plugin is a coherent group of resources for one domain — for example web development, KX13 migration, or project lifecycle. Add a new plugin only when the capability does not fit the theme of any existing plugin.

New plugins must be registered in **both** marketplace manifests.

### Skill

A skill packages a repeatable task as instructions an AI assistant loads on demand.

Follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) for the `SKILL.md` format, frontmatter fields, and directory layout. Also follow [Skill creation — best practices](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/best-practices) for scoping, progressive disclosure, and what to put in `references/` vs `assets/`.

### Markdown conventions

- `argument-hint` frontmatter uses bracketed lowercase-hyphenated placeholders, `?` marks optional arguments: `argument-hint: "[migration-plan-path] [appsettings-path?]"`.
- Quote all frontmatter values; order fields `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `compatibility`.
- Placeholders in templates use single curly braces: `{project name}`.
- In `SKILL.md` and files under `references/` and `assets/`, reference in-repo resource files with backtick paths (`` `references/docs.md` ``) rather than Markdown links. The agent reads a path; a link only adds syntax around one.
- On the surfaces people read — the root `README.md`, every plugin `README.md` and `MCP-setup.md`, and the pages under `docs/` — link every in-repo file a reader might open, with the path relative to the linking file. A plugin README references the repository licence as `` [`LICENSE.md`](../../LICENSE.md) ``. Readers meet these documents rendered on GitHub, where an unlinked path is a dead end. Keep backticks alone for a class of file rather than one file, as in "each plugin's `MCP-setup.md`", and for generated output such as `migration-detail.md`.
- Use Markdown links for external URLs.

### Subagent

A subagent is a focused worker that runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt and a restricted tool set. Each subagent is defined as a single Markdown file inside the plugin's `agents/` directory.

## Versioning the marketplace manifests

### Per-plugin `version` (inside each plugin entry)

Bump when **that plugin's contents** change.

| Bump  | When                                                                                                 |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Major | Breaking change inside the plugin — renamed/removed skill, agent, or command; incompatible behavior. |
| Minor | Additive — new skill, agent, command, or hook inside the plugin.                                     |
| Patch | Slight change inside a resource — bug fix, prompt tightening, doc tweak, internal refactor.          |

### Marketplace `metadata.version` (top of each marketplace file)

**Every plugin change bumps the marketplace version** — at least a patch.

| Bump  | When                                                                    |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Major | Breaking change in plugin structure — plugin removed or renamed.        |
| Minor | Non-breaking change in plugin structure — plugin added.                 |
| Patch | Changes inside plugins or README files — no change in plugin structure. |

Both marketplace files must always have matching versions and matching plugin entries.

## GitHub releases

The GitHub release version is aligned with the marketplace version — every marketplace version bump gets a matching GitHub release. The repository code owners create the release right after the PR is merged to main.
