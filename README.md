## What is KentiCopilot?

KentiCopilot is an agent plugin marketplace for Xperience by Kentico development. Each plugin packages task-specific skills, reference material, and optional helper tooling that an AI coding assistant loads when relevant.

The plugins are tested with GitHub Copilot and Claude Code. The skills follow the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) and can be adapted to other compatible assistants.

This repository contains several plugins, each addressing a specific product area or scenario. See each plugin's README for its requirements, invocation examples, outputs, and limitations.

   ```

2. Open the Extensions sidebar and search `@agentPlugins` to browse and install available plugins.

### Copilot CLI

copilot plugin marketplace add Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kenticopilot
copilot plugin install kentico-web-development@xperience-by-kentico-kenticopilot

/plugin marketplace add Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kenticopilot
